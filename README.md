# Sheron Yang Portfolio Website
This is the sourcecode for my personal website.   
Some design and composition ideas come from Keita Yamada's Portfolio: https://p5aholic.me/   
The style.css, script.js, and trial.html files are referenced from: https://codepen.io/Callum-Martin/pen/KoaMgM     
The elastic cursor idea comes from: https://codepen.io/gusevdigital/pen/MWxyXRa     
The loader idea comes from: https://css-loaders.com/filling/     
Hope you enjoyed the design!
