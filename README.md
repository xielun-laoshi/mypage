# Sheron Yang Portfolio Website
I made a summarization of all projects and made it into another frontend project, basically.   
Some design and composition ideas come from Keita Yamada's Portfolio: https://p5aholic.me/   
The style.css, script.js, and trial.html files are cited from: https://codepen.io/Callum-Martin/pen/KoaMgM   
The elastic cursor idea comes from: https://codepen.io/gusevdigital/pen/MWxyXRa     
Hope you enjoyed the design!
